https://morenovalleymasterchorale.org	Membership	https://morenovalleymasterchorale.org/pages/faq.php	~ Frequently Asked Questions~Welcome to the Moreno Valley Master Chorale! The following information addresses our mutual top-three concerns: time, money, and concert attire.Time: Attend weekly rehearsals regularly. We meet every Monday from 7:00pm to 9:00pm. The chorale cannot grow and blend without the stability of regular attendance. Dress rehearsal attendance is mandatory.Money: The Chorale is a self-supporting, non-profit organization. We pay our conductor, accompanist, and concert musicians. We pay for music, advertising, and rehearsal and concert venues. To defray these costs, we collect $80 in dues per trimester from each singer. Or you can pay $200 for the entire year -- a savings of $40.Concert attire: Men wear black tuxedoes and black shoes to performances. Bow tie and cummerbund colors to be announced. Women wear black shoes and a purchased uniform, usually a top and skirt combination. To create a uniform look on stage, women please refrain from flashy jewelry or hair ornaments. Also, in consideration of our members with allergies, please do not wear perfume or aftershave on concert night.We hope we have answered most of your questions about the Chorale. If you have any other questions, please e-mail us. The Chorale is made up of wonderful people who have joined together to share a love of vocal music.
